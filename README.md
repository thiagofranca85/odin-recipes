# Odin Project - Project Recipes

* About - This first project in Foundations - Recipes, I build an index page and 3 links to recipes I choose over the internet. The source of those recipes was RecipesfromItaly.com.

Files created in this project:
- Index contains a photo of an Italian chef in cartoon style and links to 3 recipes.
- In the folder "recipes" I created lasagna.html / spaguetti.html / polenta.html
- In the folder "images" I put all images used in this project.

Regarding CSS style I will stylize those pages in the next step in Odin's project path.
In this 1st step, I just created the raw pages using HTML tags, as they instructed.

The project took around 3 hours to be done.
