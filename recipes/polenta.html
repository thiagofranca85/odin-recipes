    <h1>Authentic Creamy Italian Polenta</h1>
    <p>
        Authentic Creamy Italian Polenta or Polenta Concia is one of the traditional 
        polenta recipes from northern Italy. <br><br>
        <em>“Concia”</em> in the dialect of these Italian mountain areas means “fat-greasy”. 
        The peculiarity of this recipe is in fact the addition of plenty of cheese and 
        butter to the basic polenta recipe. <br><br>
        Typical of the Italian <em>“cucina povera“</em>, creamy polenta was in fact the main 
        meal of farmers and shepherds for its low cost and its high satiating and 
        energetic power.

        The cheeses used are typical of every single region. For this reason there is 
        no a unique recipe in Italy for Polenta Concia. <br><br>
        For example, in Val Tellina they use Bitto cheese, in Friuli Montasio, in Valle 
        D’Aosta Fontina and finally in Lombardy Gorgorzola. You can also use a mix of 
        cheeses, according to your taste. <br><br>
        To make this Italian recipe of creamy polenta concia, we are going to use 
        Fontina, butter and some grated Parmigiano cheese. <br><br>
        But believe us, you can really use any cheese you prefer or have on hand. 
        These cheeses, along with the butter, will make the polenta creamy, soft and 
        irresistible! <br><br>
        Like Italian cheese fondue and many other typical mountain dishes, Polenta 
        Concia is certainly not a low-calorie dish. But it’s the ideal comfort-food in 
        the coldest days or simply to give us for once a unique delicacy!

    <h4>Kitchen Tools and Equipment</h4>
        <p>
            Polenta has always been cooked in Italy in a <em>“paiolo”</em>: apot made of copper 
            or a non-stick cauldron with a high thickness to spread the heat evenly and 
            to cook the corn perfectly. <br><br>
            You need a long wooden spoon because the polenta has a long cooking time and 
            you have to stir it often. At the beginning mix with a hand whisk: it helps 
            not to form lumps. <br><br>
            Of course today there are many tools that help us to make an excellent 
            polenta without working too hard. So have a look to this beautiful electric 
            polenta copper pot. <br><br>
            It’s better to serve creamy Italian polenta in large pasta bowl that keep 
            the polenta hot longer. <br><br>
